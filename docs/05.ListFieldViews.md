# List Field Views#

## Default ##

By default we have the following list editor field views

## Label ##

If no view is specified on the `UIOMaticListViewField` attribute the label field view will be used

    [UIOMaticListViewField]
    public string Name { get; set; }

### Optional Config ###

You can specify a filter that can be applied to the value when working with the label view (formatting as currency as relative date, truncating, ... you can basicily use any available AngularJS filter)

    [UIOMaticListViewField(Config = "{'format' : '{{value|relativeDate}}'}")]
    public DateTime Created { get; set; }

## Image ##

	[UIOMaticListViewField(View = UIOMatic.Constants.FieldViews.Image)]
	public string Picture { get; set; }

## Custom ##

It is of course also possible to plug in third party ones.

Simply point the View parameter to the location of a custom view, and you'll be able to work with the variable property.value in AngularJS

	[UIOMaticListViewField(View = "~/App_Plugins/Example/static.map.html")]
	public string Location { get; set; }
