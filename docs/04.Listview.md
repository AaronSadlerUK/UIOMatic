# Listview #

UI-O-Matic also provides the option to display your objects in a listview (since the tree isn't the best choice when working with a lot of data).

## UIOMatic Attribute RenderType Property ##

You can specify the render type on the *UIOMatic* attribute (by default this is set to Tree)

    [UIOMatic("dogs", Dogs", "Dog", FolderIcon = "icon-users", RenderType = UIOMaticRenderType.List)]

Now you won't see the items in the tree anymore but in a list view

You can sort the listview by clicking on the table headers and the listview is also searchable.

## Decorate properties with the UIOMaticListViewField attribute ##
As with the editor, in order for fields to be displayed in the list view, they must be decorated with the *UIOMaticListViewField* attribute

	[UIOMaticListViewField]

You can also specify additional parameters

- Name, a friendly display name for the property, otherwise the property name is used
- Order, sets the order in which this item should appear in the list
- View, if you wish to change the default label view




		[UIOMaticListViewField(View = UIOMatic.Constants.FieldViews.Image)]


There are a couple out of the box views you can use

- label (default)
- image

Besides the out of the box ones you can also use a completely custom one 

    [UIOMaticListViewField(Name = "Location", View = "~/App_Plugins/Example/map.static.html")]

## Adding a list view filter with the UIOMaticListViewFilter attribute ##

On the list view it's also possible to setup filters, simply mark the property you wish to use as a filter with the *UIOMaticListViewFilter* attribute

    [UIOMaticListViewField]
    [UIOMaticListViewFilter]
    public string LastName { get; set; }

### Result ###
