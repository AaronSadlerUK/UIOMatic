## IUIOMaticRepository ##
By default a model marked with the UIOMatic attribute will be using the standard repository (fetching it's data from the db)  if you wish to change this you can set the parameter RepositoryType to your own type.



## IUIOMaticObjectService ##
By default UIOMatic is using PetaPoco as it's ObjectService but you could swap that with a custom one by implementing the IUIOMaticObjectService interface and then switching the default provider type in the App_Plugins\UIOMatic\UIOMatic.config file

So you could replace PetaPoco for another ORM like Entity Framework
