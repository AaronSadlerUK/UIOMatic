# List View Actions #

By default the [list view](02.Listview.md) offers CRUD functionality but you can further extend this with custom actions.

## UIOMaticAction Attribute ##


    [UIOMaticAction("export", "Export", "~/App_Plugins/UIOMaticAddons/export.html", Icon = "icon-document-dashed-line")]
    public class ExportAction { }

Simply create a new class and mark it with the *UIOMaticAction* attribute, the attribute has a constructor with 3 parameters

- Alias, the unique alias of your action
- Name, the name that is displayed for the action
- View, the view that will be opened

Optionally you can also specify an Icon
